This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app.

Getting Started
First, run the development server:

Open command line
- cd bmo
- cd bmowebsite
- then ...
- npm run dev


or
- yarn dev


Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

If any errors, install Yarn:
https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/

or Nodejs ..
https://nodejs.org/en/



You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.js. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

API routes can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in pages/api/hello.js.

The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/*. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.
